The Diffuser Offline error message can occur for multiple reasons. Discover what may be causing the error here.

## WiFi

If your Pura diffuser won't stay connected to your internet, you may have a WiFi compatibility issue. Pura diffuser's are incompatible with the following WiFi settings: 

- **5Ghz WiFi**
- **Hidden networks**
- **Mac address authentication**
- **WiFi that requires you to enter a username**
- **Additional security features** 

If you have one of these settings, you can work with your WiFi network provider to make changes required for your Pura diffuser. For more information on your WiFi configurations, please see our article WiFi Network Requirements

## Power Issues

Your app may signal a Diffuser Offline message if your diffuser has been unplugged, disconnected, or has become unresponsive. You can check to ensure your diffuser is still receiving power. Here's how:

- Press the reset button once briefly to see if the diffuser lights up. If it does, your diffuser is receiving power. 
- Make sure the diffuser is plugged into an outlet receiving power. If that outlet does not receive power, move it to another outlet, and press the reset button again. 

If your diffuser is not receiving power, please reach out to our Customer Care team by filling out the Contact Us form.
